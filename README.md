### Context:
During my 8-month internship at EdVisorly, I was the company's very first User Experience Researcher, where I built UX research processes and design team culture from the ground up. I designed the entire interface of the EdTech software by wireframing and prototyping using <b>Figma</b> for 7M+ potential users. I conducted user interviews to <b>understand their pain points and needs</b> and to improve the user experience on the software. As well as re-designing a course planning feature, I was responsible for <b>creating new features</b> that enable students to discover universities, connect and build relationships with administrative members and peers. I collaborated with a fellow design intern, along side a technical project manager, a developer, and the COO.
